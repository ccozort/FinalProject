# FinalProject
 my final project for class...
I made this game  for my Bell Intro to Computer Class Fall 2022...

FinalGame:
A game where a player has to move up through three levels of a game and to move on needs to reach the prie

Description:

You start out on level one. This is the easiest level to pass. Once you reach the prize, a small box, the next level will show up, a level sligtly more difficult than the previous. Its the same thing, where the player has to navigate to the prize. Then the third and final level will pop up. This level is ubstantially more difficult and when the reach the prize the game will show a new screen saying you win.
